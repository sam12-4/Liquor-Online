# Project Restructuring

This document outlines the restructuring that was done to improve the organization and maintainability of the Liquor Online Clone project.

## Directory Structure Changes

### Client-side Restructuring

1. **Component Organization**:
   - Created `components/common/` for shared components
   - Created `components/layout/` for layout components
   - Created `components/ui/` for UI-specific components
   - Moved existing components to their appropriate directories

2. **Feature-based Organization**:
   - Created `features/` directory with subdirectories for products, cart, checkout, and auth
   - Each feature has its own components, hooks, and services

3. **Service Layer**:
   - Created `services/api/` for API-related functionality
   - Implemented `client.js` for making HTTP requests
   - Implemented `endpoints.js` for defining API endpoints
   - Created service files for specific resources (e.g., `productService.js`)

4. **Custom Hooks**:
   - Created `hooks/` directory for custom hooks
   - Implemented `useProducts.js` for product-related functionality

5. **State Management**:
   - Created `contexts/` directory for React contexts
   - Implemented `CartContext.js` for managing the shopping cart

6. **Utilities and Constants**:
   - Created `utils/` directory for utility functions
   - Created `constants/` directory for application constants
   - Implemented `formatters.js` for data formatting
   - Implemented `routes.js` for route definitions

### Server-side Structure

The server-side code was already well-organized with a clear separation of concerns:

- `config/`: Configuration files
- `controllers/`: Request handlers
- `models/`: Database models
- `routes/`: API routes
- `middleware/`: Express middleware
- `utils/`: Utility functions

## Component Improvements

1. **Reusable UI Components**:
   - Created `ProductCard` component for displaying product information
   - Created `ProductGrid` component for displaying multiple products
   - Created `Pagination` component for paginating through results

2. **Context-based State Management**:
   - Implemented `CartContext` for managing the shopping cart state
   - Created custom hooks for accessing context data

3. **API Integration**:
   - Created a centralized API client for making HTTP requests
   - Defined API endpoints in a single location
   - Created service functions for specific resources

## Documentation Improvements

1. **README Files**:
   - Updated root README.md with project overview and setup instructions
   - Created client README.md with frontend documentation
   - Updated server README.md with backend documentation

2. **Code Documentation**:
   - Added JSDoc comments to functions and components
   - Documented parameters and return values
   - Added explanatory comments for complex logic

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Improved Maintainability**:
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Modular and reusable components
   - Consistent organization patterns

2. **Better Scalability**:
   - Feature-based organization makes it easier to add new features
   - Reusable components reduce duplication
   - Service layer abstracts API communication

3. **Enhanced Developer Experience**:
   - Easier to find and understand code
   - Consistent patterns across the codebase
   - Better documentation

4. **Code Reusability**:
   - Common components can be reused across the application
   - Utility functions centralized in one location
   - Consistent API access through services
